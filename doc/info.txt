IXCmdSink
The user defines derived class from this abstract class to handle events of the XCommand object.
IXImgSink
The user defines derived class from this abstract class to handle events of the XAcquisition object.
XAcquisition
This class is in charge of getting image data from the X-GCU.
XAnalyze
Provides the basic analysis functions.
XCommand
This class is in charge of command controlling of the X-GCU.
XDevice
Wraps the basic parameters of the X-GCU which is used as argument by other classes.
XDisplay
Is in charge of displaying frames. Only available for the Windows system.
XDualEngCorrect
Reconstructs the dual energy image of the interlaced dual-energy raw data.
XDualLineCorrect
Reconstructs the line sequence of the dual-line detector sub-system.
XFrameTransfer
Gets line data from the XAcquisition object and combines line data into frame.
XGigFactory
Is in charge of generating objects of network.
XImage
Wraps frame data.
XMultiTransfer
When connecting with the multi-detector synchronizes each XFrameTranser object and generates the whole frame.
XOffCorrect
Provides off-board gain and offset correcting functions for all operational modes except non-continuous hi/lo trigger mode.
XOffHLCorrect
Provides off-board gain and offset correcting functions only for non-continuous hi/lo trigger mode.
XPiecewiseCorrect
Provides off-board three points piecewise correction functions for all operation modes except non-continuous hi/lo trigger mode.
XPixelCorrect
Provides functions to correct bad pixels.
XReferenceCorrect
Provides functions to correct signal variations caused by LINAC X-ray source.
XSystem
This class communicates with the X-GCU by broadcast, which reads and sets the Ethernet configurations of the X-GCU.
XTifFormat
Provides manipulating ways of TIFF format image.
